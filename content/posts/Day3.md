<b>Intro to Statistics </b>

<b>Population</b> - Total collection of objects that are of interest in a statistical study.

<b>Sample </b>- Subset, is typically smaller than the population. In a statistical study, all elements of a sample are available for observation, which is not typically the case for a population.

<b>Measurement</b> -  Number or attribute computed for each member of a population or of a sample.

<b>Sample Data</b> - Measurements of sample elements are Example Avg cost of sample of cars which is taken from population.

<b>Parameter</b> - Characteristic of a population. In a statistical study the value of a parameter is typically unknown.

<b>Statistics</b> - Number computed from the sample data.

<b> General Definition: Statistics </b>
<br>
Collection of methods for collecting, displaying, analyzing, and drawing conclusions from data.
<br>

<b>Descriptive statistics</b> - Involves organizing, displaying, and describing data.

<b>Inferential statistics </b>- Involves drawing conclusions about a population based on information contained in a sample taken from that population.

<b>Data types</b>

<b>Qualitative data </b>are measurements for which there is no natural numerical scale, but which consist of attributes, labels, or other non-numerical characteristics.

<b>Quantitative data</b> are numerical measurements that arise from a natural numerical scale.

<b>Note:</b>

1. Sample values are also called as random variable because the value varies from sample to sample

2. Larger sample values will nearer to the actual values of the population but larger values like census we cannot find average value so we go with probability

3. Using Inferential statistics we cannot find the accurate values of the population so we will predict a range and also state the accuracy % of the value occurrence will be provided

4. Unbiased (Di versed) Sampling gives us more accurate values of the population.

<b>Data representation</b>

Generally classified into three types.
1. <b>Steam and Leaf </b><br><br>

2. <b> Frequency histograms</b>

<br>
3. <b>Relative Frequency histograms</b>
<br> <br>

<br><br>
<b>Note:</b> Very fine relative frequency histograms will gives smooth curve hiding the rectangular boxes. The values under the curve is called as Area under the curve.
<br><br>

<b>Mean</b> - Average value of the data

<b>Median</b> -  Arrange the data in numerical ascending order and find the position of the middle element

<b>Mode</b> -  The highest frequency the particular data in data set

<b>Range</b> - Set is difference between its largest and smallest values

<b>Variance</b> - (X- Mean)2/N for population for sample (X-Mean)2/n-1

<b>Standard deviation</b> - Square root of Variance
